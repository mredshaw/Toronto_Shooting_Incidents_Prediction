# Toronto_Shooting_Incidents_Prediction
The purpose of this project is to develop predictive models for the Toronto Police Services (TPS) to forecast shooting call volumes based on neighborhood metrics and weather factors. The goal is to provide solutions to allocate resources more effectively across police divisions to reduce or prevent future incidences.
